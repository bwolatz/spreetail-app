This application was made for a potential employer to show programming tendencies and capabilities. Please take any code here with that grain of salt.

Application: To-Do List

User Stories:

- As a user, I need to see a list of current items in a to-do list, so I can view all work that needs to be done.

- As a user, I need to add new items to the to-do list, so I can track new work that needs to get done.

- As a user, I need to be able to mark to-do list items as done, so I can track work as it gets completed.

Thought process:

Since this needs to be front end, I will work with an advanced javascript library. I will use Angular 4 since I have not used it in a while and think it will work will with the single page, and since it is incredibly easy to start an application with (given functionality such as `ng new`). Typescript will enable me to build objects for easy organization. 

Installation: Clone the repository. Change into the correct directory and run `npm install`. After the dependencies get downloaded, got to `localhost:4200` and check it out!
